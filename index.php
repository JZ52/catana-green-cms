*    "Catana CMS" was developed by LeoCRAFT Digital in 2020.
*    "Сatana CMS" is a stripped down version of the "TRONE Engine" platform that I developed in feb 2017
*    The author of the platform is Dmytro Cherepanov, Ukraine, Mariupol.
*    This platform is free for open and commercial use.
*    Exceptions are:
*        An attempt to sell the platform itself or its code fragments;
*        Assignment of copyright or extradition of the platform for
*        its development in any of its modifications.
*    You can develop sites, modify code or modules, but you must always refer to the source.
*    When developing any project using this platform, you must mention that you are using "Catana CMS"
*    You should not remove from the code any mention of the platform and its developer. 
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*
* For site adaptability, our development of "magic.css" & "magic.js" is used.
* As a WYSIWYG editor, our development "SlipWI Editor" is used.
*
* The only third-party module that is used in "Сatana CMS" is the parser [simple_html_dom.php].
* Third-party frameworks are also connected to the admin panel: jquery.3.3.1, jquery-ui.
*
* Enjoy Your Development!
